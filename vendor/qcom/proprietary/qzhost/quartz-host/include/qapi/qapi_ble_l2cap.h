 * @details
 * L2CAP provides connection-oriented and connectionless data
 * services to upper layer protocols with protocol multiplexing
 * capability, segmentation and reassembly operation, and group
 * abstractions.  L2CAP permits higher level protocols and applications
 * to transmit and receive L2CAP data packets up to 64 kilobytes
 * in length.

/**
 * @brief
 * Sends L2CAP data to

 *
 * @details
 * This function is similar to the qapi_BLE_L2CA_Fixed_Channel_Data_Write()
 * function except that this function allows the ability to specify
 * optional queuing parameters. These queuing parameters can specify
 * the following:
 *   - How deep the queue should be (by number of queued packets)
 * This function provides two mechanisms when the (optional) queue
 * thresholds are reached:
 *   - Discard the oldest packet in the queue (and queue the specified
 *     packet)
 *   - Do not queue the packet and inform the caller via a specific
 *     return value
 *
 * If this function returns the Error Code:
 *
 *   QAPI_BLE_BTPS_ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER_SPACE,
 *
 * this is a signal to the caller that the requested data
 * could not be sent because the requested data could not be queued
 * in the Outgoing L2CAP Queue. The caller then, must wait for the:
 *
 *   QAPI_BLE_ET_FIXED_CHANNEL_BUFFER_EMPTY_INDICATION_E
 *
 * Event before trying to send any more data.
 *
 * If this function is called with QueueingParameters set to NULL,
 * this function operates like the legacy
 * qapi_BLE_L2CA_Fixed_Channel_Data_Write() function.
 *
 * If this function is called with a non-NULL QueueingParameters,
 * the data is queued conditionally. If successful, the
 * return value will indicate the number of packets that are
 * currently queued on the specified channel at the time the
 * function returns.
 *
 * If the L2CA_QUEUEING_FLAG_DISCARD_OLDEST is specified,
 * this function will discard the oldest packet in the queue
 * if the queue threshold criteria is satisfied. This allows
 * a streaming-like mechanism to be implemented (i.e., the data
 * will not back up, it will just be discarded).
